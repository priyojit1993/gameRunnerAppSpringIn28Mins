Simple Spring boot application to demonstrate the core concept of spring

In this application we will be developing a game runner java application in multiple iterations

1. Iteration 1: Tightly coupled java code
2. Iteration 2: Loosely coupled java code using interface segregation.
3. Iteration 3: Loosely coupled spring Level1.
4. Iteration 4: Loosely coupled spring Level2.
